# Checklist App

This is a simple checklist app built with JavaScript, npm, and TypeScript. The app allows users to create and manage checklists for their Team.

### Installation

Make sure you are in the GraphXSource Trusted IP's list, so you can get automatic updates to your app. Otherwise you'll not get automatic updates to your app and will have to come back to this page for any update.

For instalation simple go to the latest release tab and download the file you need. **If you're in mac**, download the setup.dmg file and **if your're on windows**, download the setup.msi or setup.exe file. Either one is fine.

If you're using any other OS... No

### Usage

Currently, the app is in early development process, so there's no usage yet. Soon we will update this page to let you know how to use it.

## Contributing
Install electron & typescript globaly if you don't have it already:
```bash
npm install electron -g
npm install typscript -g
```

Clone the repo, then intall the dependencies of the project:
```bash
npm install
```

For starting the app use:
```bash
npm run start
```

This will compile all the source code in the src folder and then run your electron app with the compiled code. No need to run the **tsc** command. But if you want to preview without running electron, then you will have to compile and open it from react.

You can find their documentation here:
[Electron Docs](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/)
[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
[React](https://react.dev/learn)
